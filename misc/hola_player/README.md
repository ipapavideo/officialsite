## Self hosting

You can also [Download](https://github.com/hola/hola_player/raw/v1.0.140/dist/hola-player-1.0.140.zip) prebuilt package and host it on your website.
You will also need to update the location of the swf files `videojs.swf` and `videojs-osmf.swf`.

Important: If you are using HolaSpark or HolaCDN features you must retain the 'customer=<id>' param of the url even after moving Hola player to your servers.

```html
<script src="//www.example.com/path/to/hola_player/hola_player.js?customer=xxx"></script>
```
Otherwise no param is required

```html
<script src="//www.example.com/path/to/hola_player/hola_player.js"></script>
```

Also you MUST specify new swf locations explicitly. Copy our swf files to a location on your site and setup the paths as follows:

```html
<script>
    window.hola_player({
        swf: "//www.example2.com/other/path/to/swf/videojs.swf",
        osmf_swf: "//www.example3.com/another/path/videojs-osmf.swf"
    });
</script>
```

First, [fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the hola/hola_player git repository. At the top of every github page, there is a Fork button. Click it, and the forking process will copy Hola Player into your own GitHub account.

Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"

> git pull upstream master
> ```

Install the required node.js modules using node package manager

npm install
```

> A note to Windows developers: If you run npm commands, and you find that your command prompt colors have suddenly reversed, you can configure npm to set color to false to prevent this from happening.
> `npm config set color false`
